## About
aCRET issues and verifies blockchain-based records for academic credentials at Ashoka University. <br/> The open standard ensures the public and secure  verifiability of digital records.
  
## Implementation Details
We used MERN stack to build a fully functional website and on top of that, used Truffle, as the backend, to write and deploy smart contract on Ropsten Testnet and Drizzle, as the frontend, to get the smart contract state as a Redux store and interact with it.
